## 💡 Concept

I got the assignment to create a website purely based on the needs of one person. For me, this person was Marijn Meijles, who suffers from a motor disorder. He has difficluties with using the keyboard and navigating his way through websites. My job was to create a drag & drop that Marijn was able to use.

As I was building just for him, I wanted to dedicate my design fully on his lifestyle. He enjoys beers and books in his spare time. Therefore, I decided to build my drag & drop in these two themes. Marijn can drag & drop the images of beers or books and put theme on a timeline. The place Marijn decides to drop his image, declares the satisfaction he gets from reading or drinking it. Below are the starting screens of both themes.
